# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

Project 12 is a stage of the back-end, we start to hands off on the front-end of the WTWR, and hands on the back-end of it, which means we need to through the two main tools to build up a database for the WTWR. In particular, we will use the Express to code the mechanical system for the user and clothingitem of WTWR to connect with the APIs, and the new generated data will be organized and managed on mogooseDB

In this project 12, we had gone through the Express.js, postman, and MongoDB tools to set up the entire data infrastructure, and coding the three main parts in VSC. Like the Routes, Models, Controllers, and app.js.
In whcih Postman is playing a role like error handling test. Any INVALID ID, NOT_FOUND, and INTERNAL_SERVER errors will be check out through this step, and this is the way for us to better know the specific reasons and where to fix it.

In this project, we also throught the ACTION button on Github to double check weather the whole process of test is complete or incomplete from postman and vsc. For instance, we can see the test errors from the postman, and it cooresponding the term: "test.endpoint" on github; And other errors from the terminal, and this part shows on github is the term: "test.config". Once they both get done in green color will mean that the project is qualified to submmit to get review.
