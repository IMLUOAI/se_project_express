# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

In this project 12, we had gone through the Express.js and MongoDB tools to set up the entire data infrastructure and coding the three main parts in VSC. Like the Routes, Models, Controllers, and app.js. Finally, the project get passed the test on the Postman.

In this project, we also throught the ACTION button on Github to double check weather the whole process of test is complete or incomplete from postman and vsc. For instance, we can see the test errors from the postman, and it cooresponding the term: "test.endpoint" on github; And other errors from the terminal, and this part shows on github is the term: "test.config". Once they both get done in green color will mean that the project is qualified to submmit to get review.

## Running the Project

`npm run lint`

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
